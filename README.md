I have kept the styling at a bare miniumum for you to go wild and make it your own. Please tag me as I would LOVE to see your game!!!

After creating my Random Beer generator in React, I decided to take one step back and create it using super simple vanilla JavaScript with HTML and CSS. This was mainly to show those who have never used React before how to make API get requests, and also to showcase the use of fetch().

Thanks to punkapi.com for their BrewDog catalogue API.
